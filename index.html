            The Icosahedron seen on screen was made using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
            Using the THREE.js library, I created many JS objects that interact with one another to render, animate, and display the polygon.
            Along the way, lighting was integrated using a spotlight object as well as a background and floor using planes.
            The rotation speed is easily changed as well as the colors of all objects seen on screen.
            The most challenging part of this project was creating a light source that I found acceptable.
            Lighting in computer graphics is often times hard to debug and configure, and I found that the SpotLight object was a suitable fit for this project.
